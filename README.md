## Build

### Prerequisites

ILAng requires CMake (3.9.6 or above) and compilers with C++17 support.
To install dependencies on Debian-based Linux:

```bash
apt-get install bison flex z3 libz3-dev
```

To install dependencies (besides [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)) on Fedora-based Linux:

```bash
yum install bison flex
```

To install dependencies on OSX:

```bash
brew install bison flex z3
```


### Default Build

To build ILAng with default configuration, create a build directory and make:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. 
make
```

If you are using git older than `1.8.4`, init the submodule from root and disable config-time submodule fetching:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DILANG_FETCH_DEPS=OFF
make
```

After the build complete, run unit tests (optional) and install the library. 

```bash
make run_test
sudo make install
```

### Options

-   Use `-DILANG_FETCH_DEPS=OFF` to disable config-time submodule fetching.
-   Use `-DILANG_BUILD_TEST=OFF` to disalbe building the unit tests.
-   Use `-DILANG_BUILD_SYNTH=ON` to enable building the synthesis engine (required [Boost](https://www.boost.org)). 
-   Use `-DILANG_BUILD_INVSYN=OFF` to disable building invariant synthesis feature.
-   Use `-DILANG_BUILD_SWITCH=ON` to enable building [smt-switch](https://github.com/makaimann/smt-switch.git) interface support. 
-   Use `-DILANG_BUILD_COSIM=ON` to enable building [Xilinx cosimulation](https://www.linuxsecrets.com/xilinx/QEMU%20SystemC%20and%20TLM%20CoSimulation.html) support.
-   Use `-DILANG_INSTALL_DEV=ON` to install working features. 

## CMake Integration

You can use the `ilang::ilang` interface target in CMake. 
This target populates the appropriate usage requirements for include directories, linked libraries, and compile features. 
To use the ILAng library, `ilang++.h` is the file to include. 
(This does not include working features.)

```c++
// cxx source

#include <ilang/ilang++.h>

void foo () {
  auto m = ilang::Ila("new_ila_model");
}
```

An example can be found in the template repo [PrincetonUniversity/template-ila](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/template-ila).

### External

To use the ILAng library from a CMake project, you can locate it directly with `find_package()` and use the namespaced imported target from the generated package configuration:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt

find_package(ilang REQUIRED)

add_library(my_proj ...)

target_link_libraries(my_proj PRIVATE ilang::ilang)
```

### Embedded

ILAng also supports embedded build, but is not recommended due to its size. 
To embed the library directly into an existing CMake project, place the entire source tree in a subdirectory and call `add_subdirectory()` in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt

add_subdirectory(ilang)

add_library(my_proj ...)

target_link_libraries(my_proj PRIVATE ilang::ilang)
```

### Supporting Both

To allow your project to support either an externally installed or an embedded library, you can use the following pattern:

```cmake
# Top level CMakeLists.txt

project(MY_PROJ)

option(MY_PROJ_USE_EXTERNAL_ILANG "Use an external ILAng library" OFF)

add_subdirectory(externals)

add_library(my_proj ...)

target_link_libraries(my_proj PRIVATE ilang::ilang)
```

```cmake
# externals/CMakeLists.txt

if(MY_PROJ_USE_EXTERNAL_ILANG)
  find_package(ilang REQUIRED)
else()
  add_subdirectory(ilang)
endif()
```

`externals/ilang` is then a complete copy of this source tree, if enabled.

## Docker Image

[![docker-io](http://dockeri.co/image/byhuang/ilang)](https://hub.docker.com/r/byhuang/ilang)

An docker image with the ILAng platform and all dependencies can be fetched from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/byhuang/ilang).

```bash
docker pull byhuang/ilang:latest
```

Once the container is initiated, run 

```bash
source init.sh
```

to initialize the environment settings. 
This docker image also contains the model checker [CoSA](https://github.com/cristian-mattarei/CoSA) with the SMT solver [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).
