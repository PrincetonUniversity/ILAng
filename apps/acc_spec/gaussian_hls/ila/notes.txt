fetch valid: (arg1_valid == 1) || (arg0_ready == 1)

read instruction:
    DECODE: (arg_0_TREADY == 1) && (stencil_full == 1)
    Assumption: (arg_1_TVALID == 0) for one-hot encoding 

    apply gaussain operation on the stencil and output to the port

write instruction: 
    DECODE: (arg_1_TVALID == 1) && (slice_full == 0)
    Assumption: (arg_1_TREADY == 1)

    store the 1x1 byte into 2-D line buffer
    export 1x9 slice into 1-D line buffer (abstract slice stream)
    export 9x9 stencil to stencil buffer (abstract stencil stream)

write child instruction 1:
    DECODE: (slice_full == 1) && (stencil_full == 0)


inputs:
    arg_0_TREADY    -- output stream ready
    arg_1_TVALID    -- input stream valid
    arg_1_TDATA     -- input stream data

arch states:
    arg_0_TVALID    -- output stream valid
    arg_0_TDATA     -- output stream data
    arg_1_TREADY    -- input stream ready

    LB2D_buff[0~7]  -- eight 488x1 bytes buffer in 2-D line buffer
    LB2D_x_idx      -- x counter in 2-D line buffer
    LB2D_y_idx      -- y counter in 2-D line buffer
    LB2D_w_idx      -- buffer write index in 2-D line buffer (y % 8)
    slice_buff      -- one 1x9 bytes slice in slice stream
    slice_full      -- slice stream status (internal_full_n in slice)
    LB2D_shift[0~7] -- eight 1x9 bytes slice in 1-D line buffer
    stencil_buff    -- one 9x9 stencil in stencil stream
    stencil_full    -- stencil stream status

possible child states:
    SW: internal states in line buffer, buffer index
    HW: internal states in line buffer, fsm state
