# Instruction-Level Abstraction (ILA)

Formal definition and modeling scenarios: [ILA Wiki](https://github.com/Bo-Yuan-Huang/ILA/wiki/).

To build ILA synthesis tool, look in the [synthesis/libcpp](https://github.com/Bo-Yuan-Huang/ILA/tree/master/synthesis/libcpp) directory. 

For some examples, see the [examples](https://github.com/Bo-Yuan-Huang/ILA/tree/master/examples) directory.

For API documents and tutorials, see the [docs](https://github.com/Bo-Yuan-Huang/ILA/tree/master/docs) directory.
